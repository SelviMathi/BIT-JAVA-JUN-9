Design and implement a simple Bank Management System using Java OOP concepts and Command Line Interface (CLI). The program must allow users to create bank accounts and perform basic banking operations.

1. Create a class BankAccount with the following attributes:
   - accountNumber (int)
   - accountHolderName (String)
   - balance (double)

2. Initialize all the above attributes using a constructor. In Main.java, create an object of BankAccount and initialize its values.

3. Make all data members of BankAccount private.

4. Implement a CLI menu in Main.java with the following options:
   1. Create Account
   2. Deposit
   3. Withdraw
   4. Show Account Details
   5. Exit

5. Create a subclass SavingsAccount that extends BankAccount and includes a method applyInterest() that adds 5% interest to the balance.
