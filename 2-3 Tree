A  2-3 Tree is a B-tree of order 3.
That means each node can contain:

1 data element (2-node)
→ has 2 children (or none, if it's a leaf)

2 data elements (3-node)
→ has 3 children (or none, if it's a leaf)

The tree remains perfectly balanced, meaning all leaves are at the same level.

| Property             | Description                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node types           | 2-node (1 key), 3-node (2 keys)                         |
| Children per node    | 2-node → 2 children; 3-node → 3 children                |
| Sorted order         | All elements are stored in a sorted manner              |
| Balanced             | Every leaf is at the same depth                         |
| Insertion / Deletion | Automatically balances the tree using splitting/merging |
| Height               | `O(log n)`                                              |

what is 2_3_4 Trees?!

A 2-3-4 Tree is an extension of a 2-3 Tree. Each node can have:

1 key → 2-node

2 keys → 3-node

3 keys → 4-node (4-node is unique to 2-3-4 trees)




 Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.

It is a practical version of a 2-3-4 Tree, used in:

Java: TreeMap, TreeSet

C++: map, set (STL)

Databases, file systems

Red-Black Tree Rules
To be a valid red-black tree, it must follow these 5 rules:

| Rule No. | Rule Description                                                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣      | Every node is either **red or black**                                       |
| 2️⃣      | The root is always **black**                                                |
| 3️⃣      | All leaves (nulls) are **black**                                            |
| 4️⃣      | If a node is **red**, its **children must be black** (no two reds in a row) |
| 5️⃣      | Every path from root to leaf has the **same number of black nodes**         |
